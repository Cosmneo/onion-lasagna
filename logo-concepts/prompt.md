# Logo Design Prompt: Onion Lasagna

## Project Context
**Onion Lasagna** is a TypeScript library for building backend applications using Onion/Hexagonal Architecture. The name combines "Onion" (the architectural pattern with concentric layers) and "Lasagna" (stacked layers of delicious code).

## Design Direction
Create a **minimalist, geometric logo** inspired by leading tech companies:
- **Anthropic** — Simple, abstract, single-color mark
- **Stripe** — Clean geometric shapes
- **Linear** — Sharp, modern, monochromatic
- **Vercel** — Bold, iconic triangle
- **Supabase** — Simple abstract symbol

## Core Concepts to Explore

### 1. Layered/Nested Forms
- Concentric circles or squares representing onion layers
- Nested geometric shapes (circle within circle, square within square)
- Abstract representation of core → domain → app → infra → presentation

### 2. Stacked Elements
- Horizontal stacked lines (like lasagna layers)
- Overlapping planes or sheets
- Ascending/descending stepped forms

### 3. Monogram Approaches
- "OL" lettermark with layered treatment
- "L" with embedded layer concept
- Abstract letterform with depth

### 4. Abstract Symbols
- Hexagon (hexagonal architecture reference)
- Spiral or coil (onion layers unwinding)
- Brackets or frames suggesting containment/encapsulation

## Technical Requirements
- **Format**: SVG (vector)
- **Colors**: Single color (white on dark, black on light) — must work inverted
- **Sizes**: Must be legible at 16px, 32px, 64px, and 128px
- **Style**: Geometric, minimal, no gradients, no fine details
- **Stroke**: If using strokes, consistent weight (2-3px at 64px scale)

## What to Avoid
- Literal food imagery (no actual onions or lasagna)
- Complex illustrations
- Multiple colors
- Thin lines that disappear at small sizes
- Trendy effects (shadows, glows, 3D)

## Deliverables
Generate 6-8 distinct logo concepts as clean SVG code. Each should:
1. Be contained in a square viewBox (e.g., `viewBox="0 0 64 64"`)
2. Use only `fill` or `stroke` with a single color (`currentColor` or `#fff`)
3. Be simple enough to work as a favicon

## Example SVG Structure
```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 64 64" fill="currentColor">
  <!-- Simple geometric shapes only -->
</svg>
```
