> **Layer by layer, dependency inward, business at the core.**

A DDD + Hexagonal architecture with framework-free business logic. Each layer has a distinct purpose, dependencies flow inward, and contracts are the shared source of truth.

## Architecture at a Glance

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Presentation
        HTTP[HTTP Handlers / Controllers]
    end

    subgraph Infrastructure
        DB[Persistence / Database]
        External[External APIs]
    end

    subgraph Orchestrations
        Workflow[Workflows]
        Composition[Compositions]
    end

    subgraph BC[Bounded Contexts]
        Domain[Domain Logic / Use Cases]
    end

    Presentation --> Infrastructure
    Presentation --> Orchestrations
    Presentation --> BC
    Infrastructure --> BC
    Orchestrations --> BC
```

## Core Principles

1.  **Business Logic is Framework-Free**: Domain code never knows about HTTP or databases.
2.  **Dependencies Flow Inward**: Outer layers depend on inner layers.
3.  **Contracts are Source of Truth**: DTOs and interfaces define how layers interact.
