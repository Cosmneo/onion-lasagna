## Core Principles

### 1. Business Logic is Framework-Free

Domain code never knows about:
- HTTP frameworks (Express, Fastify, etc.)
- Database clients (Drizzle, Prisma, etc.)
- Cloud providers
- Environment variables

**Why?** Frameworks change. Your business rules shouldn't.

### 2. Dependencies Flow Inward

```
Presentation → Infrastructure → Orchestrations → Bounded Contexts
```

Inner layers never import from outer layers.

### 3. Contracts are the Source of Truth

- **Read Models** define shared data shapes
- **Request/Response DTOs** define API contracts
- Frontend and backend share the same schemas

## When to Use

### Good Fit ✅
- Medium to large applications
- Multiple bounded contexts
- Complex business rules
- Long-term maintainability matters

### Not a Good Fit ❌
- Simple CRUD apps
- Prototypes / MVPs
- Minimal business logic

## Tradeoffs

### What You Gain
- **Testability** — Pure domain logic, easy mocking
- **Flexibility** — Swap databases, frameworks
- **Clarity** — Each layer has one job
- **Scalability** — BCs can become services

### What You Pay
- **More files** — Ports, DTOs, mappers
- **Learning curve** — New developers need onboarding
- **Indirection** — Request flows through layers
