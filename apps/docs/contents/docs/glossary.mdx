## Layers

**Bounded Context (BC)**
: A logical boundary with its own domain model, language, and rules. BCs don't import from each other directly.

**Infrastructure**
: Implements outbound ports. Contains persistence (databases) and external (API clients).

**Presentation**
: HTTP handlers, controllers, access guards, and mappers.

---

## Ports

**Inbound Port**
: Interface that defines how external actors interact with the BC. Implemented by use cases.

**Outbound Port**
: Interface that defines how the BC interacts with external systems. Implemented by infrastructure.

---

## Domain

**Aggregate**
: Cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit. Enforces business invariants.

**Entity**
: Domain object with unique identity that persists over time.

**Value Object (VO)**
: Immutable object defined by its attributes, not identity. Used for type safety.

---

## Data

**DTO (Data Transfer Object)**
: Object that carries data between layers. Immutable, validated at creation.

**Read Model**
: DTO optimized for display. Returned by Query Repositories.

---

## Repositories

**Query Repository**
: Returns Read Models. Optimized for display.

**Read Repository**
: Returns Aggregates. Used before modifications.

**Write Repository**
: Persists Aggregates. Returns void or ID.

---

## Presentation

**Access Control**
: Authorization checks performed before executing use cases. Throw `AccessDeniedError` to deny access.

**Mapper**
: Pure function that transforms data between HTTP and use case shapes.
